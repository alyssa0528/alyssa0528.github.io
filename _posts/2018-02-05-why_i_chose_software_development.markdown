In high school, I took a computer science class, not because I was genuinely interested in the subject, but because it fit into my schedule and a few of my friends were taking it.

See, at that point in my life, I *knew* I was going to be a journalist. Nothing else intrigued me. I knew I was going to study journalism in college and interview people, write stories, and produce videos for a living.

All of that happened according to plan. I had the privilege to work at some major news outlets in New York City and Washington, D.C. What I didn’t expect to happen, though, was to fall out of love with journalism. There were various reasons, but ultimately, the industry itself was changing so drastically before my eyes, and I didn’t think it was for the better. I knew I needed a career change, so I looked to my strengths and interests to see what could be transferrable to another potential career. 

Personality-wise, I like order and editing documents (it comes with the journalism territory), and I’m a stickler for following instructions. Even as a kid, my favorite toys were the ones that required following specific steps: Legos, jigsaw puzzles, Lite-Brite. I remember having this paperback book that was filled with BASIC code for our IBM PCjr. I had no idea what any of the code meant (I must have been around four years old at the time), but I knew that if I typed the combination of letters and punctuation marks keystroke by keystroke, I’d be rewarded with some cool games or graphics. I spent many an afternoon doing that and having a lot of fun with it. 

But on the opposite end of the spectrum, I love being creative. The idea of telling a new story everyday through words, video, and audio was what got me passionate about journalism in the first place.  

These traits combined made me think software development would be a great field to explore. (Obviously a lot had changed from when I was that teenager in computer science class, half paying attention and goofing off with my friends.) I understood coding involved being detail-oriented, fixing errors, and writing some kick-ass, eloquent code to create useful sites and apps. Through journalism, I got to dabble in a bit of HTML and CSS while working in WordPress, and I found myself enjoying what I had taught myself so far.

This career change has been a long time coming. The fears of failure and of throwing away a career that took more than a decade to build held me back for about the past three years. I’m not really one for New Year’s resolutions, but at the start of 2018, I knew it was time to take that step towards change. I enrolled in Flatiron’s Accelerated Bootcamp Prep course a couple of days after January 1, and here I am now, a student in the full Online Web Development Program.

Needless to say, I’m really excited for all that’s to come, but I’m also still nervous. Two weeks into the bootcamp, I have definitely encountered lessons that left my head spinning. I find myself wondering, “Are other students struggling with some of these concepts, or is it just me?” After working professionally in one industry for more than a decade, it’s weird to be starting over in a field that in many ways feels extremely foreign. But everyday, I find myself eager to start new lessons and learn different concepts. Programming certainly works a different part of my brain, but it’s a welcome challenge that I find draws many parallels to journalism. I still get to write and produce—the two things I loved about being a journalist—but now with code.
