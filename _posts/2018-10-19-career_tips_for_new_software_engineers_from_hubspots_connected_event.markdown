Earlier this week, I attended a career services event called ConnectED, hosted by inbound marketing software company HubSpot. Over five hours, software engineers, tech leads, designers, product managers, and recruiters talked to us about everything from day-to-day tasks, how to apply for tech jobs, and how to tackle the dreaded technical interview. Here were my biggest takeaways from the event:

## Day in the Life of a Software Engineer
Four engineers talked for about 15 minutes each about their daily work lives. If you thought software engineers sat at a desk purely coding for eight hours a day, you'd be sorely mistaken. For the engineers who talked to us, coding seemed to take up anywhere from 2–4 hours a day, depending on the person's role (tech leads seem to do slightly less hands-on coding than individual contributors). The rest of the day entails monitoring the performance of a newly deployed feature, attending meetings with product managers and designers, fixing bugs, and participating in code reviews.

They reminded us that new software engineers aren't expected to know everything on their first day. No question is a stupid question, and you'll do well as long as you are passionate about coding and learning. 

## How to Find and Apply for a Software Engineering Role 
A tech lead and two tech recruiters gave us useful tips on the job search. The first thing the tech lead brought up is the fact we CAN be picky about the jobs we apply to. The world is our oyster, and there are so many opportunities available out there for software engineering. (Just type in "software engineer" in Indeed and see how many available jobs appear.) Don't settle! 

When thinking about the type of role you want, he suggested thinking about projects you've enjoyed working on. Play to your strengths and interests. By doing so, you'll also figure out what you DON'T enjoy doing and the types of roles you should probably avoid applying to.

He also suggested going for the *role*, not just the company's name. When you go in for the interview, be sure to ask the company about their tech stack, what you'd potentially be working on, and what the culture is like. Ask thoughtful, *relevant* questions. Don't ask an engineer about design when you're applying for a back-end engineering role (it's not relevant and it will make you look like you're after *any* job). And never ask the interviewer (i.e., engineer, designer, etc.) about salary. Any money-related questions should be directed to your recruiter/HR contact.

Another key point: Try to chat with someone at the company working in the role you're applying for. Most likely in the interview process, you'll meet with senior-level engineers or tech leads. Getting the perspective of what work life is like from a junior-level software engineer is invaluable. Don't be afraid to contact these people on LinkedIn and pick their brains. 

One of the tech recruiters started off by suggesting we consider the role of recruiters and how many CVs they receive. She herself said she gets 100 CVs *daily*, and she spends about 1–2 minutes per CV. 

That being said, your CV/resume needs to stand out. Your summary should clearly state what you're looking for. Be sure to add to your CV any side projects or coding competitions you've participated in. 

When it comes to your Technical Skills section, only add skills that you're actually comfortable talking about or demonstrating. If it's on your resume, the interviewer has free rein to ask you about it—you don't want to stumble over it on an interview! Since recruiters spend so little time reviewing a CV, try to put your skills as close to the top as possible.

Avoid listing duties and responsibilities—that's boring. Also, don't say you work well individually or on a team (everyone says that). Anything quantifiable is great. Each section should have 2–3 bullet points. 

As for cover letters, the recruiter said she personally doesn't see much importance in them anymore. However, they're useful for explaining certain circumstances, such as noticeable employment gaps, a career change, or if you're trying to find a job in a new city. 

She also mentioned that she often finds the Recommendations section on LinkedIn helpful. She also checks out a candidate's LinkedIn profile if the CV doesn't have a lot of meat to it, so make sure your LinkedIn is detailed and up to date!

One of the major takeaways I got was that **projects are key** (so it's great we create five projects through Flatiron!). They also encouraged listing half-complete projects on your resume—it's better than nothing and at least gives you a talking point during the interview. Also, showing enthusiasm, willingness to learn, and a tendency to get stuff done are key traits many tech companies will seek in a candidate. You don't have to be fluent in the exact language the company uses, but knowing a similar language or having the passion to learn it will help.

## Decoding the Technical Interview

I was most looking forward to this session since simply hearing the words "technical interview" makes my stomach churn.

Two tech leads led this discussion. They started off by saying that being good at coding does not equal being good at interviews. There's a sort of art to the technical interview that involves coding (obviously), as well as strong communication and listening skills.

Here were the six top tips they gave: 

* Practice! Have a friend give you mock questions. Also role-play being the interviewer. Get used to writing code on a whiteboard, since it's very different from typing (some companies will let you code on a text editor, while some will make you hand-write everything). 
* Sample code challenge questions on sites like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
* Listen carefully to the problem statements. Ask probing questions BEFORE writing any code.
* Talk through your thought process. It shows how you take apart a problem, and in case you veer in the wrong direction, the interviewer can help you get back on track.
* It's OK to not know something. Don't try to BS the interviewer because he/she will more than likely call you out on it. Also, even if you aren't sure of the answer, at least take a stab at how you might go about solving it because it will likely get you some credit. 

The tech leads then did three mock interviews with each other on a virtual whiteboard. The first two attempts showed what not to do:
* Don't immediately jump into writing code.
* Don't be silent. Ask questions to confirm what problem the interviewer is asking you to solve, and talk through your code while writing it.

And some additional tips for a successful technical interview:
* Use sample inputs for arguments and explain what the final solution should look like given that sample input.
* Where possible, mention edge cases. You may not be expected to code for edge cases, but asking about them shows that you're thinking holistically.
* Give variables good names so you don't trip yourself up. This is merely to make things easier for yourself!
* Get a basic solution working quickly and worry about optimizing and refactoring later. You'll often have a time limit for these challenges, so you want to at least get the code to a working state before time runs out.

Finally, don't see the interviewer as an enemy who is there to purposely trip you up. In most cases, they are there to help and guide you to the right solution. They also don't expect you to know everything (honestly, who does?). In HubSpot's case, they allow interviewees to look up stuff online, whereas some companies might not. Even if you don't know the exact syntax for a loop or function, talk it out and be honest with the interviewer. You're likely to at least get points for knowing how the problem should be approached.

## Why I Joined a Software Company
The final session was led by Director of Engineering Barbara McCarthy and a panel of two software engineers, a designer, and a product manager. They were asked about their backgrounds, how they ended up on HubSpot's Product team, and what they've learned through their work. Here were my key takeaways:

* Having a side project and a website/blog help make you stand out in the interview process.
* Once you start working, you're not coding 40 hours a week. Work on your soft skills. Learn how to communicate and deal with different types of people. It's easier to learn a new coding language than how to properly behave and collaborate with others. Even the DoE mentioned that this is one of the main reasons why a team can fail in the workplace.
* Working for a software company means having a great impact on others through your work. You're working on software that is potentially helping hundreds, thousands, even millions of people be more productive on a regular basis. You're effectively changing lives, which is a truly amazing and 
* Everyone experiences impostor syndrome. Don't allow it to sink in and consume you.
* Focus on learning. Don't compare yourself to others.
* Be honest during job interviews.
* Get comfortable talking about code. Be able to explain what you wrote.

The goal of ConnectED was to help demystify some of the tech job search process. In many ways, it did for me. It was great to see several live technical interview examples, especially as someone who has never had to do any sort of technical testing in an interview. Hopefully some of the above advice is helpful to you, too!
