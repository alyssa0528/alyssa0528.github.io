<p>As a teenager, my dream was to be a journalist. I loved writing, editing, and producing stories from start to finish. I pursued that dream by majoring in journalism during my undergrad and graduate school years, and then working as a journalist and video producer for such outlets as The New York Times, NBC, ABC, and PBS. However, over time I grew jaded with the industry and saw too many negative changes within it. I knew I liked creating things and that I had a sharp eye for detail, so I thought, "Why not coding?" I taught myself some of the basics through books and free online courses and enjoyed it enough to decide to take the plunge with Flatiron's Online Web Developer Program. I started in late January 2018 and I'm extremely excited to learn new concepts and languages and to embark on a new career! </p>
