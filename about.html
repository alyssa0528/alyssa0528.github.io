<p>I wasn't thrilled with my current career. I knew I liked creating things and that I had a sharp eye for detail, so I thought, "Why not coding?" I taught myself some of the basics through books and free online courses and enjoyed it enough to decide to take the plunge with Flatiron's Online Web Developer Program. I started in late January 2018 and I'm extremely excited to learn new concepts and languages! </p>
